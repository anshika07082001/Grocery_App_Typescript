                    <span className='pt-3'>SPAR Hypermarkets in India is a result of a strategic partnership between Dubai based Landmark Group's Max Hypermarkets India Pvt. Ltd. & Amsterdam based SPAR International. The company started with one store in 1932 and now comprises of 12,500+ stores in 44 countries across 4 continents. The success story of SPAR has been underpinned by a set of values that have guided the organization since its inception which was more than 80 years ago. At the heart of these core values is the commitment of SPAR stores worldwide towards Freshness, Choice, Value, & Service.</span>

                    <span className='pt-3'>Our Vision is to be the most engaging and innovative hypermarket in India, making a difference in the lives of teams, customers, communities and shareholders, Everyday!</span>
                    <span className='pt-3'>Freshness has always been a prime focus area and a competitive strength for SPAR. We have pioneered processes, practices, & supply chain techniques that help maintain and boost freshness at all SPAR India stores. We believe in offering the freshest of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat & poultry products, sourced locally or imported, for all our customers - whether they walk in or buy them at our online store - www.sparindia.com. To uphold our value of Freshness, we introduced a 'Farmers Market' section where local produce is procured directly from the farmers and transported to SPAR collection centers. Here, the produce is graded and delivered to all SPAR stores within short span of time, ensuring freshness. We also introduced a section called 'Freshly' which provides value-added services to our customers. Here, they can get fresh fruit juices, salads, and other food items which are freshly made for them.</span>

                    <p className='fw-bold'>Innovation: A way of life at SPAR</p>
                    <span>Our stores are equipped with smart technology to provide world-class service to our customers. We have created a food kiosk - this star-studded interactive technology provides customers with delicious recipes with a simple click. The platform lists essential ingredients and required measurements so that the customer can get a more focused shopping experience. Our self-assist kiosks come with a call facility. These kiosks are available across the store which helps the customer to locate the exact aisle and shelf, thereby cutting down idle store time. It is inbuilt with a call facility which enables customer call support. The call facility sends an immediate intimation to the nearest store assistant, thereby not leaving the customer unattended.</span>
                    <span>Long queues consume one's family's precious time, especially during the holiday season. Keeping this in mind, SPAR India developed a Q Buster solution. To customer's delight, self-checkout kiosks have now become a reality through online & offline modes. Now, customers, can themselves scan the items, and pay for them without having to stand in long queues.</span>
                    <span>For the first time in the retail space, a brand has ventured into the local hawker market with a purpose to organize the unorganized sector. SPAR India collaborated with push-cart vendors of various localities to introduce SPAR on Wheels. The pilot project in Bangalore operates with a 'Click & Collect' business model, which helps you get fresh fruits and vegetables right at our customers' doorstep. All they need to do is order their essentials online.</span>
                    <span>At SPAR India, we are constantly pushing the boundaries and innovating. To cater to the new generation of customers we evolved our store design. Some of these developments are:</span>
                    <span>Landmark Rewards is a truly personalized rewards program where one can enrol for free with just their mobile number, when they shop at any of the Landmark Group stores in India. The new program comes with a host of benefits like:</span>
